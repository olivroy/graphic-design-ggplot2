I planned to create a visualization using small multiples to show various outcomes of the scenarios I ran with my simulation model. I was already using the R programming language for years and quickly came across the graphics library ggplot2 which comes with the functionality to easily create small multiples.to visualize my data. I never liked the syntax and style of base plots in R, so I immediately fell in love with the idea and implementation of ggplot2s Grammar of Graphics. But because I was short on time, I plotted these figures by trial and error and with the help of lots of googling. The resource I came always back to was a blog entry called Beautiful plotting in R: A ggplot2 cheatsheet by Zev Ross. After giving the talk which contained some decent plots thanks to the blog post, I decided to go through this tutorial step-by-step. I learned so much from it and directly started modifying the codes and adding additional code snippets, chart types, and resources. Fast forward to 2019. I successfully finished my PhD and started participating in a weekly data visualization challenge called #TidyTuesday. TidyTuesday is an initiative grown out of Jesse Mostipak and the R4DS Online Learning Community, started by Thomas Mock. Every week, a raw data set is with the aim to explore and visualize the data with ggplot2. Thanks to my experience with the tidyverse and especially ggplot2 during my PhD and the open-source approach of the challenge that made it possible to learn from other participants, my visualizations quickly became more advanced and complex. A few months later, I started working as a freelance data visualization specialist. I am now using ggplot2 every day: for my scientific work, design requests, reproducible reports, and personal data visualization projects. Since the blog entry by Zev Ross was not updated sine January 2016, I decided to add more examples and tricks to my version, which was now hosted on my personal blog. It became step by step a unique tutorial that now contains also the fantastic patchwork, ggtext and ggforce packages, a section of custom fonts and colors, a collection of R packages tailored to create interactive charts, and several new chart types. The updated version now contains ~3.000 lines of code and 188 plots and received a lot of interest from ggplot2 users from a wide range of fields. Today, on a sunny day in July 2021, this tutorial serves as the basis for the book you hold in your hands. I hope you enjoy it as much as I enjoyed learning and sharing ggplot2 wizardry! Why read this book Often, people that use common graphic design and charting tools or have basic experience experience with ggplot2 cannot believe what one can achieve with this graphics libraryand I want to show you how one can create a publication-ready graphic that goes beyond the traditional scientific scatter or box plot. ggplot2 is already used by a large and diverse group of graduates, researchers, and analysts and the current rise of R and the tidyverse will likely lead to an even increasing interest in this great plotting library. While there are many tutorials on ggplot2 tips and tricks provided by the R community, to my knowledge there is no book that specifically addresses the complete design of specific details up to building an ambitious multi-panel graphic with ggplot2. As a blend of strong grounding in academic foundations of data visualization and hands-on, practical codes, and implementation material, the book can be used as introductory material as well as a reference for more experienced ggplot2 practitioners. The book is intended for students and professionals that are interested in learning ggplot2 and/or taking their default ggplots to the next level. Thus, the book is potentially interesting for ggplot2 novices and beginners, but hopefully also helpful and educational for proficient users. Among other things, the book covers the following: Look-up resource for every-day and more specific ggplot adjustments and design options Practical hands-on introduction to ggplot2 to quickly build appealing visualization Discussion of best practices in data visualization (e.g. color choice, direct labelling, chart type selection) along the way Coverage of useful ggplot2 extension packages Ready-to-start code examples Reference implementations illustrating code solutions and design choices Structure of the book Chapters 1 introduces a new topic, and  Software information and conventions The book was written with the knitr package (Xie 2015) and the bookdown package (Xie 2021) with the following setup: xfun::session_info() ## R version 4.1.0 (2021-05-18) ## Platform: x86_64-w64-mingw32/x64 (64-bit) ## Running under: Windows 10 x64 (build 19041) ## ## Locale: ## LC_COLLATE=German_Germany.1252 ## LC_CTYPE=German_Germany.1252 ## LC_MONETARY=German_Germany.1252 ## LC_NUMERIC=C ## LC_TIME=German_Germany.1252 ## system code page: 65001 ## ## Package version: ## base64enc_0.1.3 bookdown_0.22 ## bslib_0.2.5.1 compiler_4.1.0 ## digest_0.6.27 evaluate_0.14 ## fs_1.5.0 glue_1.4.2 ## graphics_4.1.0 grDevices_4.1.0 ## highr_0.9 htmltools_0.5.1.1 ## jquerylib_0.1.4 jsonlite_1.7.2 ## knitr_1.33 magrittr_2.0.1 ## markdown_1.1 methods_4.1.0 ## mime_0.11 R6_2.5.0 ## rappdirs_0.3.3 rlang_0.4.11 ## rmarkdown_2.9 rstudioapi_0.13 ## sass_0.4.0 stats_4.1.0 ## stringi_1.7.3 stringr_1.4.0 ## tinytex_0.32 tools_4.1.0 ## utils_4.1.0 xfun_0.24 ## yaml_2.2.1 Package names are in bold text (e.g., ggplot2), and inline code and filenames are formatted in a monospaced typewriter font (e.g., readr::read_csv('data.csv')).

To make the plots manageable we are limiting the data to Chicago and 19972000. For more detail on this data set, consult Roger Pengs book Statistical Methods in Environmental Epidemiology with R. You can download the data we are using during this tutorial here: https://cedricscherer.com/data/chicago-nmmaps.csv (but you dont have to). We can import the data into our R session for example with read_csv() from the readr package which allows to import data directly from a web URL.

You provide the data, tell ggplot2 how to map variables to aesthetics, what graphical primitives to use, and it takes care of the details. Consequently, a ggplot is built up from a few basic elements: Data: The raw data that you want to plot. Geometries geom_: The geometric shapes that will represent the data. Aesthetics aes(): Aesthetics of the geometric and statistical objects, such as position, color, size, shape, and transparency Scales scale_: Maps between the data and the aesthetic dimensions, such as data range to plot width or factor values to colors. Statistical transformations stat_: Statistical summaries of the data, such as quantiles, fitted curves, and sums. Coordinate system coord_: The transformation used for mapping data coordinates into the plane of the data rectangle. Facets facet_: The arrangement of the data into a grid of plots. Visual themes theme(): The overall visual defaults of a plot, such as background, grids, axes, default typeface, sizes and colors. Note: The number of elements may vary depending on how you group them and whom you ask. 1.3 A Basic ggplot First, to be able to use the functionality of ggplot2 we have to load the package (which we can also load via the tidyverse package collection): library(tidyverse) ## -- Attaching packages -------------- tidyverse 1.3.1 -- ## v ggplot2 3.3.5 v purrr 0.3.4 ## v tibble 3.1.2 v dplyr 1.0.7 ## v tidyr 1.1.3 v stringr 1.4.0 ## v readr 1.4.0 v forcats 0.5.1 ## -- Conflicts ----------------- tidyverse_conflicts() -- ## x dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter() ## x dplyr::lag() masks stats::lag() The syntax of ggplot2 is different from base R. In accordance with the basic elements, a default ggplot needs three things that you have to specify: the data, aesthetics, and a geometry. We always start to define a plotting object by calling ggplot(data = df) which just tells ggplot2 that we are going to work with that data. In most cases, you might want to plot two variablesone on the x and one on the y axis. These are positional aesthetics and thus we add aes(x = var1, y = var2) to the ggplot() call (yes, the aes() stands for aesthetics). However, there are also cases where one has to specify onkly one or even three or more variables. Note: We specify the data outside aes() and add the variables that ggplot maps the aesthetics to inside aes(). Here, we map the variable date to the x position and the variable temp to the y position. Later, we will also map variables to all kind of other aesthetics such as color, size, and shape. (g &lt;- ggplot(chic, aes(x = date, y = temp))) FIGURE 1.1: A default plot generated with the ggplot2 package with variables mapped to x and y. Hm, only a panel is created when running this. Why? This is because ggplot2 does not know how we want to plot that datawe still need to provide a geometry! ggplot2 allows you to store the current ggobject in a variable of your choice by assigning it to a variable, in our case called g. You can extend this ggobject later by adding other layers, either all at once or by assigning it to the same or another variable. Note: By using parentheses while assigning an object, the object will be printed immediately (instead of writing g &lt;- ggplot(...) and then g we simply write (g &lt;- ggplot(...))). There are many, many different geometries (called geoms because each function usually starts with geom_) one can add to a ggplot by default (see here for a full list) and even more provided by extension packages (see here for a collection of extension packages). Lets tell ggplot2 which style we want to use, for example by adding geom_point() to create a scatter plot: g + geom_point() FIGURE 1.2: A default scatter plot of temperature measured in Chicago created with the ggplot2 package. Nice! But this data could be also visualized as a line plot (not optimal, but people do things like this all the time). So we simply add geom_line() instead and voilá: g + geom_line() FIGURE 1.3: The same data shown as a line chart. One can also combine several geometric layersand this is where the magic and fun starts! g + geom_line() + geom_point() FIGURE 1.4: Again, the same data, now shown as a connected scatterplot as a combination of points and lines. Thats it for now about geometries. No worries, we are going to learn several plot types in Chapter charts. 1.4 Change Properties of Geometries Within the geom_* command, you already can manipulate visual aesthetics such as the color, shape, and size of your points. Lets turn all points to large fire-red diamonds! g + geom_point(color = &quot;firebrick&quot;, shape = &quot;diamond&quot;, size = 2) FIGURE 1.5: We can change the appearance of the geometry, here illustrated by turning the black dots in larger, red diamonds. Note: ggplot2 understands both color and colour as well as the short version col. You can use preset colors (here is a full list) or hex color codes, both in quotes, and even RGB/RGBA colors by using the rgb() function. g + geom_point(color = &quot;#b22222&quot;, shape = &quot;diamond&quot;, size = 2) g + geom_point(color = rgb(178, 34, 34, maxColorValue = 255), shape = &quot;diamond&quot;, size = 2) FIGURE 1.6: Comparing two ways of specifying the color in ggplot2. Each geom comes with its own properties (called arguments) and the same argument may result in a different change depending on the geom you are using. g + geom_point(color = &quot;firebrick&quot;, shape = &quot;diamond&quot;, size = 2) + geom_line(color = &quot;firebrick&quot;, linetype = &quot;dotted&quot;, size = .3) FIGURE 1.7: You can style each geometrical layer on its own. Each geometry also comes with a set of individual properties. 1.5 Replace the default ggplot2 theme And to illustrate some more of ggplots versatility, lets get rid of the grayish default ggplot2 look by setting a different built-in theme, e.g. theme_bw()by calling theme_set() all following plots will have the same blacknwhite theme. The red points look way better now! theme_set(theme_bw()) g + geom_point(color = &quot;firebrick&quot;) FIGURE 1.8: We can change the appearance for all following plots generated with ggplot2 by globally setting another theme via theme_set(). You can find more on how to use built-in themes and how to customize themes in the section themes. From the next chapter on, we will also use the theme() function to customize particular elements of the theme. Note: theme() is an essential command to manually modify all kinds of theme elements (texts, rectangles, and lines). To see which details of a ggplot theme can be modified have a look hereand take some time, this is a looong list. "],["charts.html", "Chapter 2 Chart types 2.1 Alternatives to a Box Plot 2.2 Create a Rug Representation to a Plot 2.3 Create a Correlation Matrix", " Chapter 2 Chart types 2.1 Alternatives to a Box Plot A box plot is probably the most commonly used chart type to compare distribution of several groups, at least in the scientific literature. Box plots are great, but they can be so incredibly boring. Also, even if you are used to looking at box plots, remember there might be plenty people looking at your plot that have never seen a box and whisker plot before. A box-and-whisker plot (sometimes called simply a box plot) is a histogram-like method of displaying data, invented by J. Tukey. The thick middle line notates the median, also known as quartile. The limits of the box are determined by the lower and upper quartiles, Q¹ and Q³. The box contains thus 50% of the data and is called interquartile range (IQR). The length of the whiskers is determined by the most extreme values that are not considered as outliers (i.e. values that are within 3/2 times the interquartile range). FIGURE 2.1: A boxplot is a standardized way of displaying the dataset based on a five-number summary: the minimum, the maximum, the sample median, and the first and third quartiles. There are alternatives, but first we are plotting a common box plot: g &lt;- ggplot(chic, aes(x = season, y = o3, color = season)) + labs(x = &quot;Season&quot;, y = &quot;Ozone&quot;) + scale_color_brewer(palette = &quot;Dark2&quot;, guide = &quot;none&quot;) g + geom_boxplot() FIGURE 2.2: A box plot generated with ggplot2 with customized axis labels and colors. 2.1.1 Dot Plots Lets plot just each data point of the raw data: g + geom_point() FIGURE 2.3: A dot plot visualizing the distribution of the raw data as an alternative to boxplots. However, the summary statistics are not shown anymore. Not only boring but uninformative. To improve the plot, one could add transparency to deal with overplotting: g + geom_point(alpha = .1) FIGURE 2.4: A dot plot with added transparency as an approach to make overlapping data points visible. However, setting transparency is difficult here since either the overlap is still too high or the extreme values are not visible. Bad, so lets try something else. 2.1.2 Strip Plots Try adding a little jitter to the data. I like this for in-house visualization but be careful using jittering because you are purposely adding noise to your data and this can result in misinterpretation of your data. g + geom_jitter(width = .3, alpha = .5) FIGURE 2.5: A jittered dot plot, also known as strip plot. 2.1.3 Violin Plots Violin plots, similar to box plots except you are using a kernel density to show where you have the most data, are a useful visualization. g + geom_violin(fill = &quot;gray80&quot;, size = 1, alpha = .5) FIGURE 2.6: Violin plots are a great way to visualize the distribution values, especially in case of large sample sizes. 2.1.4 Combining Violin Plots with Strip Charts We can of course combine both, estimated densities and the raw data points: g + geom_violin(fill = &quot;gray80&quot;, size = 1, alpha = .5) + geom_jitter(alpha = .25, width = .3) + coord_flip() FIGURE 2.7: A combination of violin and strip plots to visualize the distribution and the raw values at the same time. The ggforce package provides so-called sina functions where the width of the jitter is controlled by the density distribution of the datathat makes the jittering a bit more visually appealing: library(ggforce) g + geom_violin(fill = &quot;gray80&quot;, size = 1, alpha = .5) + geom_sina(alpha = .25) + coord_flip() FIGURE 2.8: A sina plot places the dots according to the distribution and is basically a raw data violin plot. 2.1.5 Combining Violin and Box Plots To allow for easy estimation of quantiles, we can also add the box of the box plot inside the violins to indicate 25%-quartile, median and 75%-quartile: g + geom_violin(aes(fill = season), size = 1, alpha = .5) + geom_boxplot(outlier.alpha = 0, coef = 0, color = &quot;gray40&quot;, width = .2) + scale_fill_brewer(palette = &quot;Dark2&quot;, guide = &quot;none&quot;) + coord_flip() FIGURE 2.9: A combination of violin and box plots to visualize the distribution and the summary statistics of each group. 2.2 Create a Rug Representation to a Plot A rug represents the data of a single quantitative variable, displayed as marks along an axis. In most cases, it is used in addition to scatter plots or heatmaps to visualize the overall distribution of one or both of the variables: ggplot(chic, aes(x = date, y = temp, color = season)) + geom_point(show.legend = FALSE) + geom_rug(show.legend = FALSE) + labs(x = &quot;Year&quot;, y = &quot;Temperature (°F)&quot;) FIGURE 2.10: A so-called rug or bardcode plot is a powerful way to highlight the distribution along one axis without requiring much more space. 2.3 Create a Correlation Matrix There are several packages that allow to create correlation matrix plots, some also using the ggplot2 infrastructure and thus returning ggplots. I am going to show you how to do this without extension packages. First step is to create the correlation matrix. Here, we use the corrr package that works nicely with pipes but there are also many others out there. We are using Pearson because all the variables are fairly normally distributed (but you may consider Spearman if your variables follow a different pattern). Note that since a correlation matrix has redundant information we are setting half of it to NA. library(tidyverse) corm &lt;- chic %&gt;% select(death, temp, dewpoint, pm10, o3) %&gt;% corrr::correlate(diagonal = 1) %&gt;% corrr::shave(upper = FALSE) ## ## Correlation method: &#39;pearson&#39; ## Missing treated using: &#39;pairwise.complete.obs&#39; ## # A tibble: 5 x 6 ## term death temp dewpoint pm10 o3 ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 death 1 -0.486 -0.465 -0.00294 -0.238 ## 2 temp NA 1 0.958 0.368 0.535 ## 3 dewpoint NA NA 1 0.327 0.454 ## 4 pm10 NA NA NA 1 0.206 ## 5 o3 NA NA NA NA 1 Now we put the resulting matrix in long format using the pivot_longer() function from the tidyr package: corm &lt;- corm %&gt;% pivot_longer( cols = -term, names_to = &quot;colname&quot;, values_to = &quot;corr&quot; ) %&gt;% mutate(rowname = fct_inorder(term), colname = fct_inorder(colname)) ## # A tibble: 25 x 4 ## term colname corr rowname ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;fct&gt; ## 1 death death 1 death ## 2 death temp -0.486 death ## 3 death dewpoint -0.465 death ## 4 death pm10 -0.00294 death ## 5 death o3 -0.238 death ## 6 temp death NA temp ## 7 temp temp 1 temp ## 8 temp dewpoint 0.958 temp ## 9 temp pm10 0.368 temp ## 10 temp o3 0.535 temp ## # ... with 15 more rows For the plot we will use geom_tile() for the heatmap and geom_text() for the labels: ggplot(corm, aes(rowname, fct_rev(colname), fill = corr)) + geom_tile() + geom_text(aes(label = round(corr, 2))) + coord_fixed() + labs(x = NULL, y = NULL) ## Warning: Removed 10 rows containing missing values ## (geom_text). FIGURE 2.11: A basic correlation plot, created with our prepared correlation data set and the help of geom_tile(). I like to have a diverging color palette, centered at zero correlation, with white indicating missing data. Also I like to have no grid lines and padding around the heatmap as well as nicely formatted labels that are colored depending on the underlying fill: ggplot(corm, aes(rowname, fct_rev(colname), fill = corr)) + geom_tile() + geom_text(aes( label = format(round(corr, 2), nsmall = 2), color = abs(corr) &lt; .75 )) + coord_fixed(expand = FALSE) + scale_color_manual(values = c(&quot;white&quot;, &quot;black&quot;), guide = &quot;none&quot;) + scale_fill_distiller( palette = &quot;PuOr&quot;, na.value = &quot;white&quot;, direction = 1, limits = c(-1, 1) ) + labs(x = NULL, y = NULL) + theme(panel.border = element_rect(color = NA, fill = NA), legend.position = c(.85, .8)) FIGURE 2.12: A polished version of the same correlation plot with custom color palettes and theme adjustments. "],["themes.html", "Chapter 3 Themes", " Chapter 3 Themes You can change the entire look of the plots by using themes. ggplot2 comes with eight built-in themes: FIGURE 3.1: An overview of all in-build themes that are contained in the ggplot2 package.
