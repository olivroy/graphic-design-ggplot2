# About the Author {-}

Cédric Scherer is a graduated computational ecologist with a passion for design. In 2020, he combined his expertise in analyzing and visualizing large data sets in R with his interest in design and his perfectionism to become a freelance data visualization specialist. 

Cédric has created visualizations across all disciplines, purposes, and styles. Due to regular participation to social data challenges, he is now well known for complex and visually appealing figures, entirely made with ggplot2, that look as they have been created with a vector design tool.

As a data visualization specialist, he does rarely create dashboards but acts as a consultant and designer improving chart and design choices and workshop coach teaching data visualization principles and courses on R and {ggplot2}. He also uses R and the tidyverse to automate data analyses and plot generation, following the philosophy of a reproducible workflow.
